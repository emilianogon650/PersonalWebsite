<h2>Good Will Hunting(1997)</h2>

<p>I believe that everyone should watch Good Will Hunting at least once in their life. It is such a great good feel movie and also a movie with a main character who is very relatable as he struggles to make decisions about his uncertain future and deal with trauma from his past.</p>

<h2>Batman: The Dark Knight(2008)</h2>

<p>This film is great in part because of the acting performance that Heath Ledger gave us as the joker. This movie introduces the joker to Christopher Nolans version of the adaptation and pushes batman to his limits. Although the Joker is fantastic Nolan as a director does a fascinating job of continuing to develop Christian Bale's batman as a character. 

<h2>Who Moved My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson</h2>

<p>a short but impactful book that teaches the importance of adapting to change through a simple yet powerful parable. It emphasizes that resisting change leads to stagnation, while embracing it with a proactive mindset brings new opportunities and success. With its easy-to-understand lessons, the book helps readers navigate personal and professional transitions with resilience and optimism.</P>

<h2>The Socrates Express by Eric Weiner</h2>

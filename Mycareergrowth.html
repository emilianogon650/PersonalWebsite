<h2>Growth and where I see myself in 10 years.</h2>
<p>As I graduate from Saint Marys College with a bachelors degree in computer science I hope to attain an entry level job or internship in IT or data analysis. After graduation I will further refine my coding skills by building projects and continuing to develop my github page. I also hope to be able to attain my masters at some point within the next couple years.</p>
